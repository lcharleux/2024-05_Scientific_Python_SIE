## OUTLINE

Python is a very versatile and easy to learn open source language. It has a very large community and is today the most used language in the scientific field. This training aims to train participants to this language with a scientific perspective. The basics of the language and its ecosystem of libraries will be introduced in a first step. The essential tools such as work environments and the GIT versioning tool will also be presented. Then, the students will be put in situation on classical problems: data analysis, modeling and numerical solution of various problems, generation of quality figures. Topics will also be covered according to the needs of the group: image processing, numerical optimization, solving differential equations, machine/deep learning, code performance optimization and high performance computing. Some time will be reserved for practical work on problems related to the thesis of each participant. At the end of the module, students will have the basis to work autonomously on their research topic with Python.



## ORGANIZATION

The module is scheduled over 3 half-days (3x5h):

* Day 1: . Working with Python: working environments (Visual Studio Code, Jupyter). Basic programming in Python. Scientific and graphical libraries: Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numba. Various examples.
* Day 2:  Creation of a collaborative and documented library: Creation of a documented library with Sphinx in collaborative mode with Git and GitLab/GitHub. Work organization, unit tests, publication of the documentation. Work on specific scientific topics like advanced graphics for publications with Matplotlib (complex graphics, Latex couplings), image processing, optimization, solving differential equations, machine/deep learning (Scikit Learn, PyTorch), code optimization with Numpy/Numba/JAX...
* Day 3: Personal project: each participant proposes to solve a problem with the proposed methods. At the end of this session, the project is realized and returned to the form of a library or a GIT repository.


## PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH

The proposed pedagogical approach is based on examples, individually and collectively according to the participants' research themes. Through these examples, basic skills associated with scientific programming as well as tools more specific to certain themes are addressed.

## REQUIREMENTS

The prerequisites of the module are minimal:

- Come with a laptop with an internet connection.
- A GITHub account.

- Install the following software programs:
    -  For MAC OS and Linux users:

        - Mini-Forge: https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file#download
  
    - For Windows users:

        - Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download

    - Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
    - GIT: 
        - For Windows users: https://git-scm.com/downloads
        - Linux: GIT is already instlalled.
        - MAC OS: for example, install it via Brew  `brew install git` (https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/git)



## SKILLS

Skills acquired at the end of the training :

1. Know how to use Python in a basic way to solve common problems in research.
2. Find information sources and libraries to solve advanced problems.
3. Know how to structure your code to make it scalable and reusable.
4. Know how to develop a library associated with your research work in order to associate it with your publications.

## REMARKS

Each participant must come with a laptop with WIFI connection throughout the module. They must the rights to install software (disk space required: 2 GB). No computer will be provided to participants.
